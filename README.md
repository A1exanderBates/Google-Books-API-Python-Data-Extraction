# Google-Books-API-Python-Data-Extraction

In this project, I extract Google Books data with their public API using a dynamic search parameter. After retrieving the data, I parse through the dictionary file structure to retrieve volume information by book and by genre. Finally, I append and write the volume information into a csv file that is ready for data analysis or import into a database.
